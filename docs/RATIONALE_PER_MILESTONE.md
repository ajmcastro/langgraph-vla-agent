# Rationale per Milestone

Design decisions made at each milestone boundary — the "why" that should survive code churn.

---

## Milestone 0 — Foundation

### Python 3.12

**Decision:** Require Python ≥ 3.12.

**Why:** LeRobot (the library wrapping SmolVLA) explicitly requires Python ≥ 3.12 as of mid-2026. Its PyTorch requirement (≥ 2.7) also resolves cleanly with 3.12. LangGraph (≥ 1.2.0) supports Python ≥ 3.10, so 3.12 is a strict subset of both. Choosing 3.12 means the same virtual environment can host LeRobot, LangGraph, and all dev tools without a compatibility shim.

**Risk considered:** Python 3.12 type annotation syntax (`type X = Y`) is new; we use `TypeAlias` from `typing` for compatibility where needed.

### Minimal core dependencies

**Decision:** Core install (`uv sync` without extras) pulls in only `pydantic`, `structlog`, and `numpy`. LeRobot and LangGraph are optional extras.

**Why:** The mock evaluation path — which covers all agent graph tests — needs none of the ML dependencies. Keeping them optional means contributors can run the full unit test suite on any laptop without downloading gigabytes of model weights or dealing with PyTorch/CUDA setup.

**Trade-off:** The `[vla]` extra is large. First-time setup for Milestone 3+ takes time and requires either Apple Silicon + ffmpeg or a CUDA GPU. This is documented and expected.

### uv for all dependency management

**Decision:** All Python version, venv, and package operations go through `uv`. No pip, Poetry, Conda, or requirements.txt.

**Why:** `uv` provides deterministic installs from `uv.lock`, is significantly faster than pip, handles Python version management, and supports the `--torch-backend` flag for correct CUDA wheel selection on Linux. The LeRobot installation docs explicitly show `uv` as the recommended non-conda path.

### Ruff over flake8 + black + isort

**Decision:** `ruff` handles linting and formatting. `black` and `isort` are not added.

**Why:** Ruff replaces all three in a single tool with near-identical rules and is significantly faster. It's already the standard in the HuggingFace ecosystem (LeRobot uses it). mypy remains separate because ruff does not do type checking.

### Primary dataset: `lerobot/svla_so100_pickplace`

**Decision:** Identify `lerobot/svla_so100_pickplace` as the primary candidate dataset for Milestones 2–4.

**Why:** This is the reference dataset from the SmolVLA paper (arXiv:2506.01844), explicitly designed for fine-tuning `lerobot/smolvla_base`. Using it creates a direct baseline: the paper's own data → the paper's own model → our orchestration layer on top. Any improvement we measure is relative to the same starting point used to evaluate SmolVLA itself.

**Risk:** 50 episodes across 5 cube positions is small. Generalisation claims must be qualified accordingly. This is flagged as an open question for Milestone 2.
